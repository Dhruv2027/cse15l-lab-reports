# Lab Report 1
This lab report contains information regarding the 3 basic commands in command line: `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. I have already cloned the "lecture1" repository in my workspace using the command `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f23/lecture1`.

I will be beginning my report starting from the `/home` directory.

Reason for this output is that I am in the home directory (folder), ie: the default directory. If I change the working directory (the folder I am in currently) to say, `lecture1` and then enter cd again, I will return to the default `/home` directory.

I can enter the `lecture1` directory (folder) by entering the command `cd lecture1`. Here's the output:
