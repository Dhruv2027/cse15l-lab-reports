# Week 9 - Putting it all Together

# Part 1 - Debugging Scenario

### Stephen Strange (Student)
Hi, I keep failing my `merge()` method. It says that my test `"timed out after 500 milliseconds"`. I have attached the screenshot of my JUnit output and the method I am currently using. Thank you for your help.

# Part 2 - Reflection
I have learnt a lot throughout the quarter, but specifically in the second half, it was interesting to learn that I can edit files through the command line itself. I always thought that I had to open VSCode to edit my code files. However, now if I want to make a quick edit, I just use vim and make my changes. Secondly, I found using JDB was extremely useful while debugging my PAs in CSE 12. Although it took time, it was easy to understand where exactly my code was going wrong as I could see all the references using the `locals` command. I think that command is one of the most useful commands in all of java.
